## provenance

This is the python implementation of the MutEx algorithm described in the PhD Thesis "Analysis and visualization of
multidimensional cancer genomics data" : http://www.tdx.cat/handle/10803/301436

The same algorithm is also implement in Java in the Gitools software: http://www.gitools.org
